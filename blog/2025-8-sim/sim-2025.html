  <p class="small">
    This article summarizes philosopher Nick Bostrom’s influential 2003 paper, 
    <em>“Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?”</em> 
    <dt-cite key="bostrom2003simulation"></dt-cite>. The paper argues that at least one of the following propositions must be true:
  </p>

  <div class="noteBoxes type1">
    <strong>Key Takeaways</strong>
    <p class="small">
      1. Almost all civilizations go extinct before becoming technologically advanced.<br>
      2. Posthuman civilizations have no interest in running ancestor simulations.<br>
      3. We are almost certainly living in a computer simulation.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Core Argument</h2>
  <p class="small">
    Bostrom’s simulation argument is a logical trilemma. He argues that at least one of these statements must be true based on assumptions about computing power, human history, and probability. If future civilizations have the capability and desire to simulate entire human histories, then simulations will vastly outnumber actual biological civilizations — implying we’re likely in one.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Civilizational Extinction</h2>
  <p class="small">
    Technological civilizations may destroy themselves before they reach the "posthuman" stage capable of simulating minds. Risks include nuclear war, climate collapse, pandemics, or unaligned artificial intelligence.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Lack of Simulation Interest</h2>
  <p class="small">
    Even if civilizations become posthuman, they might not want to run ancestor simulations. Possible reasons: ethical concerns, legal prohibitions, lack of curiosity, or resource conservation.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Simulation Hypothesis</h2>
  <p class="small">
    If advanced civilizations exist and do run ancestor simulations, then the number of simulated minds would vastly outnumber real ones. Statistically, this implies we are almost certainly living inside one of those simulations.
  </p>

  <div class="noteBoxes type2">
    <strong>Philosophical Foundation</strong>
    <p class="small">
      Bostrom relies on anthropic reasoning: if most beings with our experiences are simulations, then we should expect to be simulations. This echoes earlier philosophical ideas like Descartes’ evil demon or the brain-in-a-vat thought experiment.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Assumptions</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>Consciousness can be simulated by computational systems.</li>
    <li>Posthuman civilizations will have enough computing power to simulate entire societies.</li>
    <li>They will choose to use those resources to simulate ancestors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Objections & Critiques</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li><strong>Technological limits:</strong> Some argue it’s impossible to simulate consciousness or entire universes in practice.</li>
    <li><strong>Moral concerns:</strong> Advanced beings may avoid simulations due to the suffering they might cause.</li>
    <li><strong>Flawed logic:</strong> Critics suggest the probabilistic argument might rely on questionable assumptions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Implications</h2>
  <p class="small">
    If we are in a simulation, it opens new questions about ethics, physics, reality, and free will. If we are not, then Bostrom’s argument suggests we face existential risks or a very different future than we imagine.
  </p>

  <div class="noteBoxes type3">
    <strong>Cultural Influence</strong>
    <p class="small">
      The simulation argument has influenced popular culture, appearing in discussions by Elon Musk and Neil deGrasse Tyson, and in films like <em>The Matrix</em> and <em>Inception</em>. It continues to provoke debate among scientists, philosophers, and technologists.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="small">
    Bostrom doesn’t say we are definitely in a simulation — only that, unless civilizations go extinct or refuse to simulate, the odds that we’re simulated become extremely high. It is a call to examine our assumptions about consciousness, technology, and the future of intelligence.
